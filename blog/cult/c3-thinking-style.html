      My expience in phase 0:<br>
      Up to this point my experience has been comforting, I understand the material and I am able to build relationships with people I've never meet face to face. both these experiences have been contrary to my initail fears in joining the program. My biggest struggle is time management. Even though I am getting the work done on time I feel like I am not managing that time efficiently. I feel I could do more. This struggle is definitely do to my learning style. I am a Concrete Random learner and rules and regulations are not something I like. Well I like to break them. My strategy for managing my time going forward will be to turn it into a game, since I like games. This game will be in the vien of <a id="smalla" href="https://www.superbetter.com">SuperBetter</a> and with the help of my fellow boots it will become a daily habit for me.</p>
