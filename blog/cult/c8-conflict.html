      <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <h4>Wednesday July 15, 2015</h4>
        <p>
          Every time I speak there is a conflict. Sometimes it's because I a wierd and my ideas are different, but usually it's because I play the devils advocate. I have my own strong opinions but I keep them to myself. However what I've found to be the most internally conflicting situations are deep conversations with people I care about. These conversations usually involves marriage, religion, morals, ethics, social or economic policy, social norms, things of that nature. I like to think of myself as open minded and I like to think of everyone else as not having fully tested their own ideals. Thus, what I am trying to do is help them to solidfy their ideas, this often leads to solidifing my own as well. It's a bit like testing for edge cases in programming, and it drives those close to me "up the wall".<br>
          <br>
          One Conflict I can recall in particular was about my ex-girlfriend's need to know everything I was doing or had done, before anyone else had the oppurtunity to tell her. For example If I were go to the movies with a friend. Before that friend tells her we went to the movies together, I would have to tell her first. What happened was that this desire of her's drove me away, not because I didn't want to tell her things but because I didn't understand the reasoning behind the way she wanted to hear them.<br>
          <br>
          The source of the conflict was essentially her hearing things about me hadn't told her first hand.<br>
          I felt helpless in the situation because not only cold I not control what others told her and/or when they did, but also becuase I could not get her to see my point of view.<br>
          I eventually broke off the relationship with her. This however was only a temporary solution. Because of course we wanted to remain "friends".<br>
          If I could go back I think I'd pass on the oppurtunity. I feel that nothing I could have said or done differently, at that moment, would have changed the ultimate outcome.<br>
          what I learned from this experience is that, if nothing else, time will resolve almost all conflicts, also that distance can give you a great perspective with which to judge past and current conflicting situattions.<br>
          <br>
          if you asked me today to break down the conflict into psuedocode this is what I would say:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>girlfriend want to be closest person to me. - wants love</li>
            <li>her hearing things second hand or after the fact hurts her - feels hurt</li>
            <li>openness is a problem for me in general (it's not personal) - doesn't trust</li>
            <li>girlfriend takes it personally - feels untrusted</li>
            <li>need to convince her to not take it personally - wants understanding</li>
            <li>--or--</li>
            <li>I must leave. - needs distance</li>
          </ul>
