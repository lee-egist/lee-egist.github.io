      <h1>First though's (not literally) about DBC</h1>
            <h4>Tuesday May 20, 2015</h4>
            <p>From everything I've seen, heard, read, and researched, the DBC experience is not to be underestimated. What I took away from the Kitchen talk with Shereef was realizing that, from the moment I started watching the video, and since I had started the phase-0-unit-1/week-1 work , I was in the restaurant mindset.I was in a position of expecting something because I paid for it. I agreed whole heartedly that falling into that idealism was easy and automatic, and trainned. However what knowledge  did was encourage me to, at that very moment, switch out of that mindset. I hate to say this because I know how it might be taken, but listening to Shereef as he spoke about those different mindset, almost felt like I was "drinking the Koolade", at a cult. I was an instant believer in making this journey my own. I wan to get the most out of this experience and for me that means talking control and responsibility for my own learning.</p>

      <h1>Thinking outside of the box</h1>
        <h4>Monday May 25, 2015</h4>
        <p>
          Did you know that on a webpage everything is a box? It's true! Every div, every table, every paragraph, everything! They are all boxes. They have a height and a width. Not only this but everything on a webpage has a natural postion by default. This is called it's static postion. That means that when you create a paragraph or any other html markdown object, it has a natural position on the webpage.<br>
          So why does this matter?<br>
          Well in the field of website design placement of objects is crucial to site usuablity, that is why most often you will find navigation links either at the top or at the left of a web page, or why copyright information is most oftern at the bottom of a webpage. These things are not often by choose, but by convention. or rather by user preferences that have become conventions.</p>

      <h1> Hashes... that good good!</h1>
        <p>
          Now i know what your thinking : <em> But isn't a hash just an array.</em> Sorry that is incorrect. well at least in ruby. In ruby a hashes is an associative array instead of being indexed like the normal array.<br>
          here is an example of a normal array:</p>
          <blockquote>
            variable1 = [100, 'two', 'knife' 'cheeseburger' ]
          </blockquote>
          <p>now here is an example of a hash:</p>
          <blockquote>
          variable2 = {"name" => "Sally", "number" => 42, "sports" => ["basketball", "baseball", "Hockey"] }
          </blockquote>
          </p>

            Well guess what you're about 9 years behind the curve there. Not to insult you late adopters but the ablitilty to download youtube video's and music has been avaliable since 2006. That being said it really didn't gain mainstream recognition until 2011.<br>
            It's call youtube-dl and it's a command line application. Despite the name this little program doesn't only work with youtube, there are well over six hundered support urls from which to download content. here is how it works:</p>
