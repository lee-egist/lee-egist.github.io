            <p>Do you ever wish you could download that amazing youtube video you just discovered?
            Well guess what you're about 9 years behind the curve there. Not to insult you late adopters but the ablitilty to download youtube video's and music has been avaliable since 2006. That being said it really didn't gain mainstream recognition until 2011.<br>
            It's call youtube-dl and it's a command line application. Despite the name this little program doesn't only work with youtube, there are well over six hundered support urls from which to download content. here is how it works:<br>

            <p>Setup</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open a terminal or command line window.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">(what is a terminal?)</a></li>
              <li>Download youtube-dl using you local package manager(apt-get, homebrew, etc..)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">(What is a package manager?)</a></li>
              <li>navigate to the folder of your choice</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Steps for downloading video's<p>
            <ol>
              <li>type youtube-dl followed by the url where the media is hosted</li>
              <li>hit enter and what the magic happen.</li>
            </ol>

            <em>youtube-dl automatically downloads the highest quality version of content possible<em>

            <p>Steps for downloading audio<p>
            <ol>
              <li>type youtube-dl --extract-audio followed by the url</li>
              <li>viola it's that easy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            the best thing about this application however is that it works on any platform linux, mac, and windows, and most UNIX based systems.<br>
            So the next time you say to yourself geez that was hilarious i wish i could watch it offline, load up your terminal or command line and grab yourself some satisfaction. You be suprised at how often this  capplication comes in handy.
