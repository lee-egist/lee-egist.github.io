        <h3>version control</h3>
        <p>
          Version control and version control systems improve the way individuals and collaborations work. A version control system is designed to track changes. Over the course of a project there are a limitless amount of changes that can happen from conception to fruition. Having a system in place that provides fine tuned control over those changes, allows for a smoother project workflow with fewer stops do to bugs or mistakes. </p>

        <h3>git</h3>
        <p>
          Git is a program designed to make version control easier and more efficient. Git enables you to maintain focus on the workflow of a project by imposing constraints on how and when you save a version. Git is local to your machine making it easier for collaborations because you don’t need a constant connection to a network. The way the git keeps track of changes is by keeping the files under it’s supervision in one of three stages. The first stage is the working stage. This is where the files are, when you are about to make changes to them. The next stage is the staging area. where you find files that you have modified but not saved. finally there is the committed area this is where you save the changes you have made. All saves in git are check-summed. what this mean is that after you have saved a version it cannot be lost.</p>

        <h3>Github</h3>
        <p>
          Github is a web-based application that allows you to store your git repositories in a remote location. The main reason for storing your code on Github is because it’s free for open source projects and allows for greater collaboration between developers.</p>
